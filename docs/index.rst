============================================================

The Simple Extensible Path Template (sept) is a simple to configure templating system designed at relatively simple path translation or path generation from a dictionary of data.

Client code can define a set of Tokens that are in the dictionary of data by creating a subclass of sept.Token. Advanced users have the ability to define custom Operators that can modify the data in the dictionary.
